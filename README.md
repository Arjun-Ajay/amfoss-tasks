## WHAT ARE YOUR FIELDS OF INTERESTS AND HOW DO YOU PLAN ON WORKING ON THEM?
I’m currently interested in various fields, including AI, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, and more. There are so many fascinating areas in tech that I find it challenging to choose just one right now, although I’m particularly drawn to AI and data science at this point. My goal is to discover the field that suits me best by actively participating in the club’s activities, collaborating on projects, and learning from the other members. I believe this "hands-on" experience will help me narrow down my interests and help me find my true passion.
